# ArchestrA.Apps.MPNZ

Some InTouch OMI apps.

### ArchestrA.Apps.MPNZ.AttributeBrowser

Shows the name, value and quality of the IO attributes on the current asset.

### ArchestrA.Apps.MPNZ.TrendApp

Loads up a trend for the current asset, and looks for all the historized attributed that contain Current or Voltage in the attribute name and adds them to the Trend.  This could be easily modified to load based on a pattern, or lookup in a file, or load up a trend file etc.

### ArchestrA.Apps.MPNZ.TitleBarApp

A slightly modified version of the default TitleBarApp, to show the seconds in the time, and remove the weird capitalisation of the user name (it now shows it as entered)
